# Rooted Forests

This file defines non-planar rooted forests as multisets of non-planar rooted
trees. These are the monomials in the commutative algebra of rooted forests.

## Main definitions

* `RootedForest` - non-planar rooted forests
* `RootedTree.branches` - the forest immediately below the root
* `RootedForest.graft` - the `B_+` operator grafting a forest onto a new root
* `RootedForest.order` - total number of vertices
* `RootedForest.treeFactorial` - product of tree factorials
