# The Algebra of Ordered Planar Forests

This file defines the noncommutative algebra freely spanned by ordered planar
forests. Multiplication is concatenation of ordered forests. The quotient maps
to the existing commutative non-planar forest algebras forget sibling order.

This is the algebraic carrier needed for ordered-tree Hopf algebras such as
the Munthe-Kaas-Wright Hopf algebra.

## Main definitions

* `PlanarForestAlgebra` - monoid algebra of ordered planar forests
* `LPlanarForestAlgebra` - labelled ordered planar forest algebra
* `PlanarForestAlgebra.toForestAlgebra` - forget planar order
* `LPlanarForestAlgebra.toLForestAlgebra` - forget planar order in the labelled case
